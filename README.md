# First-web-dev
This site making story: <br>This is my first website using HTML5 and CSS3. I developed in my semester vacation. It was developed from June 16, 2022, to June 22, 2022. 
    spent 24 Hours for Learn & Develop. I know full-stack-developer can make it with 1H or 2H. some professionals can make it 1800 sec. But I was learning HTML a little bit in my O/L 2016. I'm not far familiar with web development with code.
